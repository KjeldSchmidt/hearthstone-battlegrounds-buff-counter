# What does this do?

It adds an overlay in the Hearthstone Battelgrounds Mode that helps you count certain buff conditions. These are:

- If Majordomo Executus is in your hand or anywhere on the board, it shows how often the buff will trigger this round. (Elemtals played + 1)
- If Southsea Strongarm is in your hand or in Bob' Tavern, it shows how many pirates you have bought this turn
- If you play Edwin VanCleef or Tickatus/Finley with his hero power, it shows the number of minions you have bought this turn.

# What do I need?

This is a plugin for the [Hearthstone Deck Tracker](https://github.com/HearthSim/Hearthstone-Deck-Tracker), so you will need to install it and have it running during gameplay. You'll also have to download the latest release from here and add it into your plugins folder.

# How do I install this?

In the Hearthstone Deck Tracker, go to Options -> Tracker -> Plugins. Click "Plugins Folder" and copy the `BattlegroundsBuffCounter.dll` release you got from here into this folder.
